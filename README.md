Arduino version of firmware for MIDI footswitch box (for Line6 Bass Pod). The original
firmware was CircuitPython but it sometimes failed to boot into the application.

Supports three footswitches, each controlling a feature via a MIDI Control Change message. 
An associated LED shows the on/off state of the feature.
